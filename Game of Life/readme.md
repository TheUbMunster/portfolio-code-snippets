# "[Huffman Encoder](https://github.com/TheUbMunster/portfolio-code-snippets/tree/main/Game%20of%20Life)" - Solo project - ~July 2021 - Java C++
After messing around with marshalling for awhile, I thought it would be fun to go across many languages, rather than just one.
Originally intended for the UI to be in java, and the logic in C# (with C++ as the bridge between them), I ended up with a huge amount of
cryptic JNI errors that immediately went away when I stopeed trying the C# logic, and migrated it to C++ instead.
Still though, it works well, has a scrollable viewport, dynamic world/viewport size, as well as play/pause/step with the ability to control simulation speed.
