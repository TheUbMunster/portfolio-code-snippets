After designing and creating the custom motherboard tray for my 3D printer, when installing the motherboard I realized that the RSP module connects to the motherboard
in a way where it interferes with the fit of the motherboard. The module points "forward" over the front of the motherboard, and overhangs slightly, causing it to interfere with the wall of the case.
To solve this problem, I designed and purchased a PCB that "rotates the socket" of the RSP module by 90 degrees, so that it fits within the bounds of the case properly. Now I have Wifi controls
for my printer!

Similar to my 3D printer woes, when my second graphics card is installed in my computer case, it completely obscures all of the bottom IO, this includes the front panel connectors. Since I set up WOL,
I am able to turn on my PC with an app on my phone, but it is annoying for the power/reset buttons/lights to not work. I tried various methods to solve this, including using some male/female ribbon cables to
move the pins elsewhere, but the clearance is basically nonexistent with the GPU installed. I even considered bending the pins sideways by 90 degrees, but I didn't want to snap the pins by accident or ruin
the resale value of the motherboard. To solve this, I made another adapter board that flips the header upside down, and rotates it 90 degrees so I can access it from the bottom. Unlike this render given by 
LibrePCB, the male connector will be at a right angle.

The ability to create these circuit boards to solve these problems is a unique skill, and after sitting on these problems for awhile, these feel like the best solutions.
