# "Tutorial" - Solo project - ~April 2019 - C# - [Tutorial.zip]()
Since I love programming so much, I tried to get my father hooked on it (C# isn't a bad first language, but older dogs like him have a hard time learning
new tricks). It didn't click so much for him, but later on he got into python, and that worked out much better for him. This was a file I wrote where I tried
to explain various pieces of C# and OOP paradigms.
