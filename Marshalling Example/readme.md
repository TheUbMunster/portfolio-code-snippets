# "Marshalling Example" - Solo project - ~July 2019 - C# C++ - [Marshalling Example.zip]()
This was a simple console-line C# app I wrote to demonstrate *a* simple way to tansfer data between various "code" (written in different languages). The way
this was written isn't very safe, and I wouldn't roll this out into release code, but it was something simple in 5 minutes I could do.
