# "[Recipie Book](https://github.com/TheUbMunster/portfolio-code-snippets/tree/main/Recipie%20Book)" - Solo project - ~July 2019 - C#
My dad had a silly suggestion of writing a cooking recipie managing program. Was bored, and as a Saturday project I wrote this command line app that allows you to
read saved recipies, enter new ones, calculate multi-batches of ingredients, and print out the recipies to your default printer.
