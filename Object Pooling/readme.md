# "Object Pooling" - Solo project - Several years - C# Unity - [Object Pooling.zip]()
This was an asset I wrote to put up for sale on the unity asset store, written in C# by myself. Designed to utilize inheritance to implement object pooling
features, where each object can manage itself. Various static methods provide stand-in methods of instantiating that fetch unused objects from the pool, create
object pooling templates at runtime, remove/add objects to the pooling system, along with other features.
