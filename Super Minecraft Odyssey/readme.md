# "Super Minecraft Odyssey" - Solo Project - January 2023 - Blender Moonlight - [Mod Page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/403565)
<p>
I was inspired to get into the video game modding scene by an offhanded comment by a streamer who was streaming themselves playing a "online multiplayer mod" for super mario odyssey. Suffice it to say that
after achieving quick mild success, I had many additional ideas for what I could bring to the scene. Although I am a great coder, I have dabbled quite a bit in artwork for a long time, so I "re-skinned" one of
the primary levels belonging to super mario odyssey, making it themed in a minecraft-esq way. The mod itself has over 2.5k downloads as of writing, and has many youtube videos made on it. It was quite successful,
and I'm quite proud of it. I'm considering making more versions for other levels within the game, but we'll see what the future holds.
