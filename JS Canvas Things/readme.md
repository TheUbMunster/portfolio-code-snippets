# "[JS Canvas Things](https://github.com/TheUbMunster/portfolio-code-snippets/tree/main/JS%20Canvas%20Things)" - Solo Project - Unknown date - Javascript HTML
With my love of desmos, I thought it might be an interesting weekend adventure to write a simple [graphing calculator](https://tangleboom.com/projects.html). My comedic (in this case) aversion to libraries led me to the
html canvas tag, and with that and javascript I wrote a simple graphing calculator. The 3D rasterizer below the graphing calculator was also written completely in javascript, but was
adapted from a [C++ tutorial on rasterization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU). To view these, navigate to the "Projects" tab on this website, or click [here](../projects.html).
