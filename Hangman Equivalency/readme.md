# "[Hangman Equivalency](https://github.com/TheUbMunster/portfolio-code-snippets/tree/main/Hangman%20Equivalency)" - Solo Project - ~August 2020, January 2021 - C# F# Python Java VB C++

This project was originally an assignment for CSIS 2500, to introduce our coding styles to our teammates. "Make a hangman game" they said, I chose C# and wrote up
a quick console version of hangman. As an afterthought, I decided to convert the hangman project to as many languages as I could (with the idea that it would
be a good way to introduce me to other languages, and the syntax). However, my conversions are as close to 1:1 as I could, and as a result it was often that I
went against design patterns for a given language (e.g. F# is a functional language, but I still used mutable variables). The goal was that you could launch
any version of it and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. More versions to come! Note: The python version has a minor difference that the console can't
be cleared/refreshed upon entering input etc. because execution environment couldn't recognize system("cls") or system("clear"), otherwise identical.
