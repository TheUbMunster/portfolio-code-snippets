# "Pokemon Executables" - Group project - ~August 2020 - C# - [Pokemon.zip]()
This was a demo app I wrote that was a "proof of concept" stage along a group project I did in CSIS 2500 that allowed you to do elite
four battles through a command line interface. Database managment, account creation, etc was included in this code (not fully secured, but I believe I mitigated
all methods of SQL injection (not sure about protecting SQL injections performed upon the fetch of the data though)) passwords etc. were salted and hashed, but my
focus at this point of the project was gameplay logic, and later shifted over to more database oriented stuff.
